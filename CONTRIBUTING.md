# Contributing 
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project. However, it is best if everyone who does wish to collaborate knows the format and best practices of our code.

We try to keep only files that have been compiled in the dist folder. Files such as the main.css file after getting compiled from all the SCSS partials and the index.js file after being bundled with webpack.

The raw SCSS and JS Files belong in the source folder. Here, all the code is pretty printed so everyone can read and understand the code quickly. We use the SCSS Formatter extension to format SCSS and Prettier for everything else.

## The Current Goal
Currently, we're trying to reach a specific look and feel for the website. You can visit the samples folder and find the screenshots there. It would be appreciated if you change the website styling with those in mind.

If you have suggestions for improving the UI or the code, feel free to fork this repo and send a pull request when you're done. We would like to have as much customizability as possible so feel free to also send us suggestions of any other settings you can think would be useful here.
